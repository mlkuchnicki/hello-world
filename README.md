# hello-world
First attempt at a repository for my portfolio

I'm a director of reporting, analytics and data science at a large enterprise.  I enjoy R, Python & SQL. I've been an Enterprise Architect as well as a Big Data expert in previous positions.

I am looking forward to using this repository for show casing my DS work.
